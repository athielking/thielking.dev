          <p>Ace Calendar is a custom scheduling product which I developed as a consultant, the product was designed with ease of use in mind with the requirement of 1 worker per job per day.</p>
          <p>It features multiple views of your schedule, so you can view day, week, or month schedules.  There is also a read-only view for workers to view their schedule on any particular day, and features subscription billing through the Stripe API</p>

          <p>I designed and developed a custom web application for the World of Warcraft: Classic community. It being used by over 62k people and solves the problem of not having a central 'Guild Bank' within the Classic version of World of Warcraft.</p>
          <p>The solution was designed to utilize the in game Addon System for exporting character data, which is then uploaded by authorized members into the Classic Guild Bank website.  Those members can then share public or private links with other guild members to view the available inventory and request items if needed.</p>
