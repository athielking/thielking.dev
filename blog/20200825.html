        I wanted to start playing around with Redis and decided to try and get it installed locally on my machine. I have an Azure account but even the lowest tier of their Redis offering was more than I wanted to pay, estimated at about $16/month.
    </p>

    <p>I already had an installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux installed and I am running Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic distribution.  This first thing I did was navigate to 
        <a href="https://redis.io/topics/quickstart">https://redis.io/topics/quickstart</a> to see what their instructions said. 
       
        <pre>
            $ wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
            $ tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
            $ cd /redis-stable/
            $ make
        </pre>

        I tried running these steps verbatim and ran into a few issues
    </p>

    

    <p>
        this first failed because <b>make</b> was not installed. So we do the following: 
        
        <pre>
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install make
        </pre>
            
        Once apt finished installing everything we try running the <b>make</b> command again, and we now run into this error: 
        
        <pre>make[3]: cc: Command not found</pre>
        
        So we need to install more debian packages:
        <pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
        which will install the required compliers for building the source.
    </p>

    <p>
        Running the <b>make</b> command again we hit another snag: 
        <pre>
            In file included from adlist.c:34:0:
            zmalloc.h:50:10: fatal error: jemalloc/jemalloc.h: No such file or directory
        </pre>

        So the default configuration on linux is to use jemalloc for memory allocation.  Thanks to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47088171/error-jemalloc-jemalloc-h-no-such-file-or-directory-when-making-redis">Stack Overflow</a> post, you can change the memory allocator which redis uses by supplying an argument to make.
        <b>make MALLOC=libc</b>.  This compilation worked for me, however I wanted to see what else I needed to do to get the standard configuration to work.
    </p>

    <p>
        I learned from this <a href="https://sharadchhetri.com/jemallocjemalloc-h-no-such-file-or-directory-redis/">blog post</a> that there are dependencies which need to be compiled first before redis can be compiled. These can be built by running the following commands.
        <pre>
            $ cd deps
            $ make hiredis lua jemalloc linenoise
        </pre>

        Once those dependencies finish compiling, you can go back to the main /redis-stable folder and run the <b>make</b> command again

        <pre>
            $ cd ..
            $ make
        </pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>This should finally all compile successfully, and you'll be prompted to run a <pre>make test</pre>. In doing that I found there was still one thing missing from my system. 
        <pre>
            You need tcl 8.5 or newer in order to run the Redis test
        </pre>
        was the error message that I got.  So one more package install to get tcl:
        <pre>
            $ sudo apt-get install tcl
        </pre>
        then re-running the <b>make test</b> command, shows that the test passed.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, the order that all of this should have been done in would be something as follows

        <pre>
            $ sudo apt update
            $ sudo apt install make
            $ sudo apt install build-essential
            $ sudo apt-get install tcl
            $ wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
            $ tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
            $ cd /redis-stable/
            $ cd /deps
            $ make hiredis lua jemalloc linenoise
            $ cd ..
            $ make
        </pre>
    </p>
