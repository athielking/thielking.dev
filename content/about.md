### Who I am

My name is Andrew Thielking.  I'm a software developer currently working at a FinOps startup called ProsperOps.  We build solutions for automating discount management across all 3 major cloud providers.  If you want to save money in the cloud check us out [ProsperOps](https://prosperops.com)

### What I do

I write software professionally and I build projects on the side.  I also write instructional video courses and hands on labs for [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com).  If you're interested in checking out what I've created check out the [Pluralsight](/pluralsight) page where I keep a list of all my courses.

### What Is this site?

I don't really use social media, and I really needed to put some links down on the slides for my Pluralsight courses, so I decided to create this site. 

I've also tried multiple times to make a 'personal site' and none of the solutions ever worked all that well.  I've tried just raw html and css, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), and now I'm onto [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  I'm hoping this will stick this time.  I'm also not much of a 'blogger' but occasionally find a topic worth sharing.
