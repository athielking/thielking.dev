## Video Courses

### [Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-continuous-integration-delivery-settingup-cicd-pipeline/description)
A well-structured CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating software development and deployment.  This course will explore different options for hosting and building your CI/CD process.  We start from setting up a basic git repository and adding commits into it.  We then build on that by setting up an end-to-end build process using GitHub Actions.  We then expand into other CI/CD Platform providers: Azure DevOps and GitLab, and compare and contrast how the same build process works in each platform.

### [Working with Infrastructure as Code](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-automation-infrastructure-as-code-working-infrastructure-code/table-of-contents)
Mastering Infrastructure as Code with Terraform is essential for efficiently deploying, managing, and scaling modern infrastructure. In this course, DevOps Automation and Infrastructure as Code: Working with Infrastructure as Code, you'll learn how to use Terraform to automate and manage infrastructure deployments. First, you'll begin by mastering the basics of Terraform’s configuration and workflow, including initializing, planning, and applying infrastructure changes. Next, you’ll discover how to configure a working directory, define resources like Docker containers or S3 buckets, and verify your deployments. Finally, you'll explore how to build on these foundations and progress to managing complex, multi-container deployments, setting up network configurations, and using Terraform to update, scale, and tear down infrastructure efficiently. By the end of this course, you’ll have the practical skills needed to automate, manage, and maintain your infrastructure with confidence using Terraform’s core functionality.

### [Version Control and DevOps Foundations](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/version-control-devops-foundations/table-of-contents)
Versioning and collaboration are crucial for maintaining consistent, reliable deployments in modern application development. In this course, Version Control and DevOps Foundations, you’ll gain the ability to manage both code and infrastructure using version control systems. First, you’ll explore foundational Git practices and CI/CD techniques to streamline your development workflows. Next, you’ll discover GitOps and how it enables Kubernetes deployment automation through Git-based workflows. Finally, you’ll learn how to deploy and manage Kubernetes containers using GitOps practices, Helm charts, and Kustomize. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of Git, CI/CD, and containerization needed to build scalable, versioned, and automated software deployments.

## Hands-On Labs

### [Deploying a NodeJS WebServer](https://app.pluralsight.com/hands-on/labs/cc8e540e-e8ca-458e-9ae8-8d61328bc5b5)
In this lab, you'll practice writing a basic NodeJS webserver from scratch.  We'll start with a blank environment and work our way up to a fully functional Express.JS API.

### [Working with Infrastructure as Code](https://app.pluralsight.com/hands-on/labs/617bd064-3759-448c-915d-9f4ecf1fabc1)
In this lab, you’ll practice building Infrastructure as Code and utilizing Configuration Management tools.  When you’re finished, you’ll have a working multi-container application with networking and load balancing configured.

### [Build and Manage Infrastructure on AWS with Terraform](https://app.pluralsight.com/hands-on/labs/d34118a6-7695-4c02-9b39-200271995b53)
Learn how to build a robust Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) strategy utilizing Terraform on AWS. Get familiar with Terraform and its stateful nature, and then expand upon that by utilizing Terraform workspaces, imports, and other commands.

### [Develop and Reuse Terraform Modules](https://app.pluralsight.com/hands-on/labs/b46519ee-9f32-40d5-9c5b-55df3392a86f)
Terraform and its HCL configuration language is a powerful set of tools which enables you to build and re-use modular pieces of infrastructure. Learn how to consume publicly available modules distributed by cloud providers like AWS. Then learn about creating and consuming your own modules and re-usable pieces of infrastructure to fit your specific infrastructure needs and standards.
