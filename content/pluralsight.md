### [Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-continuous-integration-delivery-settingup-cicd-pipeline/description)
A well-structured CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating software development and deployment.  This course will explore different options for hosting and building your CI/CD process.  We start from setting up a basic git repository and adding commits into it.  We then build on that by setting up an end-to-end build process using GitHub Actions.  We then expand into other CI/CD Platform providers: Azure DevOps and GitLab, and compare and contrast how the same build process works in each platform.


## Hands-On Labs
