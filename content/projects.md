## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on which have helped me learn various different skills outside of my normal day-to-day job.

### MuniCheck

[MuniCheck](https://www.municheck.com/) is a mobile inspection application for contractors, landlords and municipal governments to effortlessly collaborate on inspections.  This project was specifically built to address many limitations of municipal ERP software such as offline capabilities and muli-unit inspector aggregation.  This project also focuses on integrating back into the enterprise ERP systems to include seamless syncing between mobile device and the system of record.

The technical details for this project include a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, backend API functionality using Go, Firebase and Google Cloud hosting.

### Classic Guild Bank

[Classic Guild Bank](https://github.com/classicguildbank) was launched for the 2019 re-release of Classic World of Warcraft.  In the original version of the game there were many quality of life features which were added in later expansions that many players had come to rely on.  One of those being the concept of a Guild Bank where members of the guild can share resources with one another.  

Classic guild bank was an in-game addon and companion website which served to replicate the Guild Bank functionality so players could keep track of what resources the Guild had available to share.  At its peak Classic Guild Bank had over 90,000 active users and was one of the most fun projects I have had the opportunity to work on.

The technical details for this project include a LUA in-game addon, and a full stack web application using C# and Angular and was hosted on Microsoft Azure.
